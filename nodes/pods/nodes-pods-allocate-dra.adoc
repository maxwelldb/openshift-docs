{attribute-based-full} enables fine-tuned control over graphics processing unit (GPU) resource allocation in {product-title}, allowing pods to request GPUs based on specific device attributes, including product name, GPU memory capacity, compute capability, vendor name and driver version. These attributes are exposed by a third-party Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) driver.

// Hiding until GA. The driver is not integrated in the TP version
// This attribute-based resource allocation is achieved through the integration of the NVIDIA Kubernetes DRA driver into OpenShift.
