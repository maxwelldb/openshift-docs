toc::[]


You can mount an Open Container Initiative (OCI)-compliant container image or artifact directly into a pod, making the files within the image accessible to the containers without the need to include them in the base image, which allows you to host the data in OCI-compliant registries.

// The following include statements pull in the module files that comprise
// the assembly. Include any combination of concept, procedure, or reference
// modules required to cover the user story. You can also include other
// assemblies.
