Knative Eventing on {product-title} enables developers to more easily declare how components of their system communicate, using an event-driven architecture for serverless applications.

Event-driven architecture is based on the concept of decoupled relationships between event producers and event consumers.

For more information about event-driven architecture, see link:https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/integration/what-is-event-driven-architecture[What is event-driven architecture?]

== Knative Eventing workflows

In a Knative Eventing workflow, _event producers_ send information to an event source about changes to system state. Examples of event producers include a Kafka cluster or the Kubernetes API server.

An _event source_ is a resource object, which is the link between an event producer and a _sink_ (or consumer) that receives those events. Currently, {ServerlessProductName} supports the following event source types:

ApiServerSource:: Connects a sink to the Kubernetes API server.
PingSource:: Periodically sends ping events with a constant payload. It can be used as a timer.

SinkBinding is also supported, which allows you to connect core Kubernetes resources such as `Deployment`, `Job`, or `StatefulSet` with a sink.

Examples of sinks are Knative services and channels. Events can also be sent to:

* A _broker_, where they can be filtered using _triggers_ before being sent to a sink. Using the broker and trigger together enables an event delivery mechanism that hides the details of event routing from the event producer and event consumer.
* A _channel_, where Knative services can "subscribe" to receive events of a certain type.
