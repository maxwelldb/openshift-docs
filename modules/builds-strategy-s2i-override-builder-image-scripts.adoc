= Overriding Source-to-Image (S2I) builder image scripts

You can override the *_assemble_*, *_run_*, and *_save-artifacts_*
S2I scripts provided by the builder image.

.Procedure

To override the *_assemble_*, *_run_*, and *_save-artifacts_* S2I scripts
provided by the builder image, either:

1. Provide an *_assemble_*, *_run_*, or *_save-artifacts_* script in the
*_.s2i/bin_* directory of your application source repository, or

2. Provide a URL of a directory containing the scripts as part of the strategy
definition. For example:

[source,yaml]
----
strategy:
  sourceStrategy:
    from:
      kind: "ImageStreamTag"
      name: "builder-image:latest"
    scripts: "http://somehost.com/scripts_directory" <1>
----
<1> This path will have *_run_*, *_assemble_*, and *_save-artifacts_* appended
to it. If any or all scripts are found they will be used in place of the same
named script(s) provided in the image.

[NOTE]
====
Files located at the `scripts` URL take precedence over files located in
*_.s2i/bin_* of the source repository.
