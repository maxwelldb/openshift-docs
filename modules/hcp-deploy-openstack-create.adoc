= Creating a hosted cluster on OpenStack

You can create a hosted cluster on {rh-openstack-first} by using the `hcp` CLI.

.Prerequisites

* You completed all prerequisite steps in "Preparing to deploy hosted control planes".
* You completed all prerequisite steps in "Prerequisites for OpenStack".
* You have access to the management cluster.
* You have access to the {rh-openstack} cloud.

.Procedure

* Create a hosted cluster by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ hcp create cluster openstack --node-pool-flavor <node_pool_flavor>
----
+
--
where:

`<node_pool_flavor>`:: Specifies the flavor of the node pool of the cluster.
--
NOTE: Many options are available at cluster creation. For {rh-openstack}-specific options, see "Options for creating a Hosted Control Planes cluster on OpenStack". For general options, see the `hcp` documentation.

.Verification
* Verify that the hosted cluster is ready by running the following command on it:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n clusters-<cluster_name> get pods
----
+
--
where:

`<cluster_name>`:: Specifies the name of the cluster.
--
+
After several minutes, the output should show that the hosted control plane pods are running.

[NOTE]
====
The {rh-openstack} resources that the cluster API (CAPI) provider creates are tagged with the label `openshiftClusterID=<infraID>`. 

You can define additional tags for the resources as values in the `HostedCluster.Spec.Platform.OpenStack.Tags` field of a YAML manifest that you use to create the hosted cluster. The tags are applied when you scale up the node pool.
