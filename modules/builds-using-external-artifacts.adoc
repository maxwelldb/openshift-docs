It is not recommended to store binary files in a source repository. Therefore,
you may find it necessary to define a build which pulls additional files (such
as Java *_.jar_* dependencies) during the build process. How this is done
depends on the build strategy you are using.

For a `Source` build strategy, you must put appropriate shell commands into
the *_assemble_* script:

.*_.s2i/bin/assemble_* File
----
#!/bin/sh
APP_VERSION=1.0
wget http://repository.example.com/app/app-$APP_VERSION.jar -O app.jar
----

.*_.s2i/bin/run_* File
----
#!/bin/sh
exec java -jar app.jar
----

ifndef::openshift-online[]
For a `Docker` build strategy, you must modify the *_Dockerfile_* and invoke
shell commands with the
link:https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#run[`RUN` instruction]:

.Excerpt of *_Dockerfile_*
----
FROM jboss/base-jdk:8

ENV APP_VERSION 1.0
RUN wget http://repository.example.com/app/app-$APP_VERSION.jar -O app.jar

EXPOSE 8080
CMD [ "java", "-jar", "app.jar" ]
----
endif::[]

In practice, you may want to use an environment variable for the file location
so that the specific file to be downloaded can be customized using an
environment variable defined on the `BuildConfig`, rather than updating the
ifndef::openshift-online[]
*_Dockerfile_* or
endif::[]
*_assemble_* script.

You can choose between different methods of defining environment variables:

* Using the *_.s2i/environment_* file] (only for a Source build strategy)
* Setting in `BuildConfig`
* Providing explicitly using `oc start-build --env` (only for builds that are triggered
manually)

//used by a Source build, see Overriding builder image scripts.
