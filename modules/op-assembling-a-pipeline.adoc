= Assembling a Pipeline

A Pipeline represents a CI/CD flow and is defined by the Tasks to be executed. It specifies how the Tasks interact with each other and their order of execution using the `inputs` , `outputs`, and `runAfter` parameters. It is designed to be generic and reusable in multiple applications and environments.

In this section, you will create a Pipeline that takes the source code of the application from GitHub and then builds and deploys it on {product-title}.

//The image below displays the various components of `pipelines-tutorial` Pipeline, and how these components interact with each other.

The Pipeline performs the following tasks for the back-end application `vote-api` and front-end application `vote-ui`:

* Clones the source code of the application from the Git repositories `api-repo` and `ui-repo`.
* Builds the container images `api-image` and `ui-image` using the `buildah` ClusterTask.
* Pushes the `api-image` and `ui-image` images to the internal image registry.
* Deploys the new images on {product-title} using the `apply-manifests` and `update-deployment` Tasks.

.Procedure

. Copy the contents of the following sample Pipeline YAML file and save it:
+
[source,yaml]

apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: Pipeline
metadata:
  name: build-and-deploy
spec:
  resources:

    runAfter:
    - apply-manifests

Notice that the Pipeline definition abstracts away the specifics of the Git source repository and image registries to be used during the Pipeline execution.

. Create the Pipeline:
+
----
$ oc create -f <pipeline-yaml-file-name.yaml>
----
+
Alternatively, you can also execute the YAML file directly from the Git repository:
+
----
$ oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/pipelines-tutorial/release-tech-preview-1/01_pipeline/04_pipeline.yaml
----

. Use the `tkn pipeline list` command to verify that the Pipeline is added to the application:
+
----
$ tkn pipeline list
----
+
The output verifies that the `build-and-deploy` Pipeline was created:
+
