= Granting user permissions using web console

This procedure shows how to grant users permissions for monitoring their own services using the web console.

.Prerequisites

* Have a user created.
* Log in to the web console as a cluster administrator.

.Procedure

. In the web console, navigate to *User Management* -> *Role Bindings* -> *Create Binding*.
. In *Binding Type*, select the "Namespace Role Binding" type.
. In *Name*, enter a name for the binding.
. In *Namespace*, select the namespace where you want to grant the access. For example, select `ns1`.
. In *Role Name*, enter `monitoring-rules-view`, `monitoring-rules-edit`, or `monitoring-edit`.

** `monitoring-rules-view` allows reading PrometheusRule custom resources within the namespace.
** `monitoring-rules-edit` allows creating, modifying, and deleting PrometheusRule custom resources matching the permitted namespace.
** `monitoring-edit` gives the same permissions as `monitoring-rules-edit`. Additionally, it allows creating new scraping targets for services or Pods. It also allows creating, modifying, and deleting ServiceMonitors and PodMonitors.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Whichever role you choose, you must bind it against a specific namespace as a cluster administrator.
====
+
For example, enter `monitoring-edit`.
. In *Subject*, select *User*.
. In *Subject Name*, enter the name of the user. For example, enter `johnsmith`.
. Confirm the role binding. If you followed the example, then user `johnsmith` has been assigned the permissions for setting up metrics collection and creating alerting rules in the `ns1` namespace.
