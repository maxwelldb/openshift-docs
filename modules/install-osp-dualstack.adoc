= Configuring a cluster with dual-stack networking

:FeatureName: Dual-stack configuration for OpenStack

You can create a dual-stack cluster on {rh-openstack}. 

For {rh-openstack} 17.1, you can deploy a dual-stack {product-title} cluster on a single-stack IPv6 {rh-openstack} infrastructure. The {product-title} cluster offers IPv4 connectivity internally, even when the underlying {rh-openstack} network only has IPv6 subnets.

For earlier versions of {rh-openstack}, you can enable the dual-stack configuration only if you are using an {rh-openstack} network with IPv4 and IPv6 subnets.

[NOTE]
====
{rh-openstack} does not support the conversion of an IPv4 single-stack cluster to a dual-stack cluster network.
