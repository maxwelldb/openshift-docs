= BMC addressing

The `address` field for each `bmc` entry is a URL for connecting to the {product-title} cluster nodes, including the type of controller in the URL scheme and its location on the network.

.IPMI

IPMI hosts use `ipmi://<out-of-band-ip>:<port>` and defaults to port `623` if not specified. The following example demonstrates an IPMI configuration within the `install-config.yaml` file.

----
platform:
  baremetal:
    hosts:
      - name: openshift-master-0
        role: master
        bmc:
          address: ipmi://<out-of-band-ip>
          username: <user>
          password: <password>
----

.RedFish

To enable RedFish, use `redfish://` or `redfish+http://` to disable TLS. The installer requires both the hostname or the IP address and the path to the system ID. The following example demonstrates a RedFish configuration within the `install-config.yaml` file.

----
platform:
  baremetal:
    hosts:
      - name: openshift-master-0
        role: master
        bmc:
          address: redfish://<out-of-band-ip>/redfish/v1/Systems/1
          username: <user>
          password: <password>
----

While it is recommended to have a certificate of authority for the
out-of-band management addresses, you must include `disableCertificateVerification: True` in the `bmc` configuration if using self-signed certificates. The following example demonstrates a RedFish configuration using the `disableCertificateVerification: True` configuration parameter within the `install-config.yaml` file.

----
platform:
  baremetal:
    hosts:
      - name: openshift-master-0
        role: master
        bmc:
          address: redfish://<out-of-band-ip>/redfish/v1/Systems/1
          username: <user>
          password: <password>
          disableCertificateVerification: True

[NOTE]
====
Currently RedFish is only supported on HPE hardware for IPI on Bare metal deployments. We are working with other vendors to enable RedFish capabilities across the board.

.RedFish Virtual Media

To enable RedFish virtual media, use `redfish-virtualmedia://`. The following example demonstrates using RedFish Virtual Media within the `install-config.yaml` file.

----
platform:
  baremetal:
    hosts:
      - name: openshift-master-0
        role: master
        bmc:
          address: redfish-virtualmedia://<out-of-band-ip>/redfish/v1/Systems/1
          username: <user>
          password: <password>
