[id="olm-building-operator-catalog-image_{context}"]
= Building an Operator catalog image

Cluster administrators can build a custom Operator catalog image to be used by
Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) and push the image to a container image
registry that supports
link:https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/manifest-v2-2/[Docker v2-2]. For a
cluster on a restricted network, this registry can be a registry that the cluster
has network access to, such as the mirror registry created during the restricted
network installation.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The {product-title} cluster's internal registry cannot be used as the target
registry because it does not support pushing without a tag, which is required
during the mirroring process.
====

For this example, the procedure assumes use of the mirror registry
that has access to both your network and the internet.

.Prerequisites


* A Linux workstation with unrestricted network access
ifeval::["{context}" == "olm-restricted-networks"]
footnoteref:[BZ1771329,The
`oc adm catalog` command is currently only supported on Linux.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1771329[*BZ#1771329*])]
endif::[]
* `oc` version 4.3.5+
* `podman` version 1.4.4+
* Access to mirror registry that supports
link:https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/manifest-v2-2/[Docker v2-2]
* If you are working with private registries, set the `REG_CREDS` environment
variable to the file path of your registry credentials for use in later steps.
For example, for the `podman` CLI:
+
----
$ REG_CREDS=${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}/containers/auth.json
----

.Procedure

. On the workstation with unrestricted network access, authenticate with the
target mirror registry:
+
----
$ podman login <registry_host_name>
----
+
Also authenticate with `registry.redhat.io` so that the base image can be pulled
during the build:
+
----
$ podman login registry.redhat.io
----

. Build a catalog image based on the `redhat-operators` catalog from
link:https://quay.io/[quay.io], tagging and pushing it to your mirror registry:
+
----
$ oc adm catalog build \
    --appregistry-org redhat-operators \//<1>
    --from=registry.redhat.io/openshift4/ose-operator-registry:v4.5 \//<2>
    --filter-by-os="linux/amd64" \//<3>
    --to=<registry_host_name>:<port>/olm/redhat-operators:v1 \//<4>
    [-a ${REG_CREDS}] \//<5>
    [--insecure] <6>

<1> Organization (namespace) to pull from an App Registry instance.
<2> Set `--from` to the `ose-operator-registry` base image using the tag that
matches the target {product-title} cluster major and minor version.
<3> Set `--filter-by-os` to the operating system and architecture to use for the
base image, which must match the target {product-title} cluster. Valid values
are `linux/amd64`, `linux/ppc64le`, and `linux/s390x`.
<4> Name your catalog image and include a tag, for example, `v1`.
<5> Optional: If required, specify the location of your registry credentials file.
<6> Optional: If you do not want to configure trust for the target registry, add the
`--insecure` flag.

Sometimes invalid manifests are accidentally introduced into Red Hat's catalogs;
when this happens, you might see some errors:

These errors are usually non-fatal, and if the Operator package mentioned does
not contain an Operator you plan to install or a dependency of one, then they
can be ignored.
