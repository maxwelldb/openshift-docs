= Creating serverless applications using YAML

To create a serverless application, you can create a YAML file and apply it using `oc apply`.

You can create a YAML file by copying the following example:

.Example Knative service YAML
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: hello
  namespace: default
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - image: docker.io/openshift/hello-openshift
          env:
            - name: RESPONSE
              value: "Hello Serverless!"
----

In this example, the YAML file is named `hello-service.yaml`.

.Procedure

. Navigate to the directory where the `hello-service.yaml` file is contained, and deploy the application by applying the YAML file:
+
----
$ oc apply --filename hello-service.yaml
----

After the service has been created and the application has been deployed, Knative will create a new immutable revision for this version of the application.

Knative will also perform network programming to create a route, ingress, service, and load balancer for your application, and will automatically scale your pods up and down based on traffic, including inactive Pods.
