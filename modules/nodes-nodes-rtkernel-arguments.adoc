= Adding a real-time kernel to nodes (after installation)

Some {product-title} workloads require a high degree of determinism.
While Linux is not a real-time operating system, the Linux real-time
kernel includes a preemptive scheduler that provides the operating
system with real-time characteristics.

If your {product-title} workloads require these real-time characteristics,
you can switch your compute (worker) and/or master machines to the Linux
real-time kernel. For {product-title}, {product-version} you can make this
switch using a MachineConfig object. Although making the change is as simple
as changing a MachineConfig `kernelType` setting to `realtime`, there are a few
other considerations before making the change:

[NOTE]
====
This procedure is fully supported with bare metal installations using
systems that are certified for Red Hat Enterprise Linux for Real Time 8.
Real time support in {product-title} is also limited to specific subscriptions.
This procedure is also supported for use with Google Cloud Platform
====

.Prerequisites
* Have a running {product-title} cluster (version 4.4 or later).
* Log in to the cluster as a user with administrative privileges.

.Procedure

. Create a MachineConfig for the real-time kernel: Create a YAML file
(for example, `99-worker-realtime.yaml`) that contains a MachineConfig
object  for the `realtime` kernelType. This example tells the cluster to
use a real-time kernel for all worker nodes:
+
----
$ cat << EOF > 99-worker-realtime.yaml
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
kind: MachineConfig
metadata:
  labels:
    machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: "worker"
  name: 99-worker-realtime
spec:
  kernelType: realtime
EOF
----
+
You can change `worker` to `master` to add kernel arguments to master nodes instead.
Create a separate YAML file to add to both master and worker nodes.

. Add the MachineConfig to the cluster. Type the following to add the MachineConfig
to the cluster:
+
----
$ oc create -f 99-worker-realtime.yaml
----

. Check the real-time kernel: Once each impacted node reboots, log in to the cluster
and run the following commands to make sure that the real-time kernel has
replaced the regular kernel for the set of worker or master nodes you
configured:
+
----
$ oc get nodes

----
+
The kernel name contains `rt` and text “PREEMPT RT” indicates that this is a real-time kernel.

. To go back to the regular kernel, delete the MachineConfig object:

$ oc delete -f 99-worker-realtime.yaml
