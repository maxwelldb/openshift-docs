= Cluster update status using oc adm upgrade status

When updating your cluster, the `oc adm upgrade` command returns limited information about the status of your update. The cluster administrator can use the `oc adm upgrade status` command to decouple status information from the `oc adm upgrade` command and return specific information regarding a cluster update, including the status of the control plane and worker node updates. Worker is also known as compute.

The `oc adm upgrade status` command is read-only and does not alter any state in your cluster.

The `oc adm upgrade status` command can be used for clusters from version 4.12 up to the latest supported release.

The `oc adm upgrade status` command will output three sections, control plane update, worker nodes update, and health insights.

* *Control Plane Update*: Displays details about the updating cluster control plane, contains a high-level assessment, completion status, duration estimate, or cluster operator health. The section also shows a table with control plane node update information.
+
The control plane update section can also show an additional table that lists cluster operators being updated if the `--details=operators` or `--details-all` flags are used. Please note that due the asynchronous distributed nature of {product-title}, an operator may appear in this section more than once during the update, or not at all. The section is only shown when a Cluster Operator is observed to be updating. It is normal during an update to observe no updating Cluster Operator at certain periods; not every performed action can be assigned to an observable updating Cluster Operator.
+
* *Worker Notes Update*: Displays the worker node update information. The worker nodes section starts with a table that displays a summary of information about each worker pool configured in the cluster. Each non-empty worker pool output will show a dedicated table listing update information about nodes that belong to that pool. If a cluster does not have any worker nodes the output will not contain the worker node section. You can make the node tables show all lines by using `--details=nodes` or `--details=all`.
+
* *Health Insights*: displays insights about states and events present in the cluster that may be relevant for the ongoing update. You can use `--details=health` to expand the items in this section into a more verbose form with more content such as documentation links, longer form descriptions, or cluster resources involved in the insight.

[NOTE]
====
The `oc adm upgrade status` command is currently not supported on {hcp} clusters.
