= Input Secrets and ConfigMaps

In some scenarios, build operations require credentials or other configuration
data to access dependent resources, but it is undesirable for that information
to be placed in source control. You can define _input secrets_ and _input
ConfigMaps_ for this purpose.

For example, when building a Java application with Maven, you can set up a
private mirror of Maven Central or JCenter that is accessed by private keys.
In order to download libraries from that private mirror, you have to supply the
following:

. A  *_settings.xml_* file configured with the mirror's URL and connection
settings.
. A private key referenced in the settings file, such as *_~/.ssh/id_rsa_*.

For security reasons, you do not want to expose your credentials in the
application image.

This example describes a Java application, but you can use the same approach
for adding SSL certificates into the *_/etc/ssl/certs_* directory, API keys or
tokens, license files, and more.
