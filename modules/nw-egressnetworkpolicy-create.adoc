= Creating an egress firewall policy object

As a cluster administrator, you can create an egress firewall policy object for a project.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If the project already has an EgressNetworkPolicy object defined, you must edit the existing policy to make changes to the egress firewall rules.
====

.Prerequisites

* A cluster that uses the OpenShift SDN default Container Network Interface (CNI) network provider plug-in.
* Install the OpenShift Command-line Interface (CLI), commonly known as `oc`.
* You must log in to the cluster as a cluster administrator.

.Procedure

. Create a policy rule:
.. Create a `<policy-name>.yaml` file where `<policy-name>` describes the egress
policy rules.
.. In the file you created, define an egress policy object.

. Enter the following command to create the policy object:
+
----
$ oc create -f <policy-name>.yaml -n <project>
----
+
In the following example, a new EgressNetworkPolicy object is created in a
project named `project1`:
+
----
$ oc create -f default-rules.yaml -n project1
egressnetworkpolicy.network.openshift.io/default-rules created
----
+
. Optional: Save the `<policy-name>.yaml` so that you can make changes later.
