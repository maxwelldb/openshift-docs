= About Triggers

Use Triggers in conjunction with Pipelines to create a full-fledged CI/CD system where the Kubernetes resources define the entire CI/CD execution. Pipeline Triggers capture the external events and process them to extract key pieces of information. Mapping this event data to a set of predefined parameters triggers a series of tasks that can then create and deploy Kubernetes resources.

For example, you define a CI/CD workflow using {pipelines-title} for your application. The PipelineRun must start for any new changes to take effect in the application repository. Triggers automate this process by capturing and processing any change events, and by triggering a PipelineRun that deploys the new image with the latest changes.

Triggers consist of the following main components that work together to form a reusable, decoupled, and self-sustaining CI/CD system:

* _EventListeners_ provide endpoints, or an event sink, that listen for incoming HTTP-based events with a JSON payload. The EventListener performs lightweight event processing on the payload using Event Interceptors, which identify the type of payload and optionally modify it. Currently, Pipeline Triggers support four types of Interceptors: Webhook Interceptors, GitHub Interceptors, GitLab Interceptors, and Common Expression Language (CEL) Interceptors.
* _TriggerBindings_ extract the fields from an event payload and store them as parameters.
* _TriggerTemplates_ specify how to use the parameterized data from the TriggerBindings. A TriggerTemplate defines a resource template that receives input from the TriggerBindings, while then performing a series of actions that result in creation of new PipelineResources and initiation of a new PipelineRun.

EventListeners tie the concepts of TriggerBindings and TriggerTemplates together. The EventListener listens for the incoming event, handles basic filtering using Interceptors, extracts data using TriggerBindings, and then processes this data to create Kubernetes resources using TriggerTemplates.
