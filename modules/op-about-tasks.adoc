= About Tasks

_Tasks_ are the building blocks of a Pipeline and consist of sequentially executed Steps. Steps are a series of commands that achieve a specific goal, such as building an image.

Every Task runs as a Pod and each Step runs in its own container within the same Pod. Because Steps run within the same Pod, they have access to the same volumes for caching files, configmaps, and secrets.

A Task uses `inputs` parameters, such as a Git resource, and `outputs` parameters, such as an image in a registry, to interact with other Tasks. They are reusable and can be used in multiple Pipelines.

Here is an example of a Maven Task with a single Step to build a Maven-based Java application.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: Task
metadata:
  name: maven-build
spec:
  resources:
    inputs:
    - name: workspace-git
      targetPath: /
      type: git
  steps:
  - name: build
    image: maven:3.6.0-jdk-8-slim
    command:
    - /usr/bin/mvn
    args:
    - install
----
This Task starts the Pod and runs a container inside that Pod using the `maven:3.6.0-jdk-8-slim` image to run the specified commands. It receives an input directory called `workspace-git` that contains the source code of the application.

The Task only declares the placeholder for the Git repository, it does not specify which Git repository to use. This allows Tasks to be reusable for multiple Pipelines and purposes.
