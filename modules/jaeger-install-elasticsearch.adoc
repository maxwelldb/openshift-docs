= Installing the Elasticsearch Operator

The default Jaeger deployment uses in-memory storage because it is designed to be installed quickly for those evaluating Jaeger, giving demonstrations, or using Jaeger in a test environment.  If you plan to use Jaeger in production, you must install a persistent storage option, in this case, Elasticsearch.

.Prerequisites
* Access to the {product-title} web console.
* An account with the `cluster-admin` role.
