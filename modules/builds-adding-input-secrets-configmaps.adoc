= Adding input secrets and ConfigMaps

In some scenarios, build operations require credentials or other configuration
data to access dependent resources, but it is undesirable for that information
to be placed in source control. You can define _input secrets_ and _input
ConfigMaps_ for this purpose.

.Procedure

To add an input secret and/or ConfigMap to an existing `BuildConfig`:

. Create the ConfigMap, if it does not exist:
+
----
$ oc create configmap settings-mvn \
    --from-file=settings.xml=<path/to/settings.xml>
----
+
This creates a new ConfigMap named *_settings-mvn_*, which contains the
plain text content of the *_settings.xml_* file.

. Create the secret, if it does not exist:
+
----
$ oc create secret generic secret-mvn \
    --from-file=id_rsa=<path/to/.ssh/id_rsa>
----
+
This creates a new secret named *_secret-mvn_*, which contains the base64
encoded content of the *_id_rsa_* private key.

. Add the ConfigMap and secret to the `source` section in the existing
`BuildConfig`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
source:
  git:
    uri: https://github.com/wildfly/quickstart.git
  contextDir: helloworld
  configMaps:
    - configMap:
        name: settings-mvn
  secrets:
    - secret:
        name: secret-mvn
----

To include the secret and ConfigMap in a new `BuildConfig`, run the following
command:

----
$ oc new-build \
    openshift/wildfly-101-centos7~https://github.com/wildfly/quickstart.git \
    --context-dir helloworld --build-secret “secret-mvn” \
    --build-config-map "settings-mvn"
----

During the build, the *_settings.xml_* and *_id_rsa_* files are copied into the
directory where the source code is located. In {product-title} S2I builder
images, this is the image working directory, which is set using the `WORKDIR`
instruction in the *_Dockerfile_*. If you want to specify another directory,
add a `destinationDir` to the definition:

[source,yaml]
----
source:
  git:
    uri: https://github.com/wildfly/quickstart.git
  contextDir: helloworld
  configMaps:
    - configMap:
        name: settings-mvn
      destinationDir: ".m2"
  secrets:
    - secret:
        name: secret-mvn
      destinationDir: ".ssh"
----

You can also specify the destination directory when creating a new
`BuildConfig`:

----
$ oc new-build \
    openshift/wildfly-101-centos7~https://github.com/wildfly/quickstart.git \
    --context-dir helloworld --build-secret “secret-mvn:.ssh” \
    --build-config-map "settings-mvn:.m2"
----

In both cases, the *_settings.xml_* file is added to the *_./.m2_* directory of the
build environment, and the *_id_rsa_* key is added to the *_./.ssh_* directory.
