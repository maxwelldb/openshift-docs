== Overview

{product-title} is capable of provisioning persistent volumes (PVs) using the Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver for AWS Elastic Block Store (EBS).

Familiarity with link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/[PVs], link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#persistentvolumeclaims[persistent volume claims (PVCs)], link:http://blog.kubernetes.io/2016/10/dynamic-provisioning-and-storage-in-kubernetes.html[dynamic
provisioning], and link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/authorization/rbac/[RBAC authorization] is recommended.

Before PVCs can be created, you must install the AWS EBS CSI Driver Operator. The Operator provides a default StorageClass that you can use to create PVCs. You also have the option to create the EBS StorageClass as described in xref:../../storage/persistent_storage/persistent-storage-aws.adoc#persistent-storage-aws[Persistent Storage Using AWS Elastic Block Store].

After the Operator is installed, you must also create the AWS EBS CSI custom resource (CR) that is required in the {product-title} cluster.

== About CSI
Storage vendors have traditionally provided storage drivers as part of Kubernetes. With the implementation of the Container Storage Interface (CSI), third-party providers can instead deliver storage plug-ins using a standard interface without ever having to change the core Kubernetes code.

CSI Operators give {product-title} users storage options, such as volume snapshots, that are not possible with in-tree volume plug-ins.

[IMPORTANT]
====
{product-title} defaults to using an in-tree, or non-CSI, driver to provision AWS EBS storage. This in-tree driver will be removed in a subsequent update of {product-title}. Volumes provisioned using the existing in-tree driver are planned for migration to the CSI driver at that time.
