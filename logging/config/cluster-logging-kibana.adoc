toc::[]

{product-title} uses Kibana to display the log data collected by Fluentd and indexed by Elasticsearch.

You can scale Kibana for redundancy and configure the CPU and memory for your Kibana nodes.

[NOTE]
====
You must set the Elasticsearch Operator to Unmanaged state before performing these configurations, unless otherwise noted.
For more information, see xref:../../logging/config/cluster-logging-management.adoc#cluster-logging-management[Changing the cluster logging management state].

Operators in an unmanaged state are unsupported and the cluster administrator assumes full control of the individual component configurations and upgrades. For more information, see xref:../../architecture/architecture-installation.html#unmanaged-operators_architecture-installation[Support policy for unmanaged Operators].
