You can deploy {hcp} with hosted clusters that run on {rh-openstack-first}.

A _hosted cluster_ is an {product-title} cluster with its API endpoint and control plane that are hosted on the hosting cluster. The hosted cluster includes the control plane and its corresponding data plane. You can use the {mce-short} console or the `hcp` command-line interface (CLI) to create a hosted cluster.
