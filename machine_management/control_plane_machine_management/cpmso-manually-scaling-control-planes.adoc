toc::[]

When installing a cluster on bare-metal infrastructure, you can manually scale up to 4 or 5 control plane nodes for your cluster. Consider this use case in situations where you need to recover your cluster from a degraded state, perform deep-level debugging, or ensure stability and security of the control planes in complex scenarios.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Red{nbsp}Hat supports a cluster that has 4 or 5 control plane nodes only on bare-metal infrastructure.
