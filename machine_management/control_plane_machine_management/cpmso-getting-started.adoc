= Getting started with the Control Plane Machine Set Operator
include::_attributes/common-attributes.adoc[]
:context: cpmso-getting-started

toc::[]

The process for getting started with the Control Plane Machine Set Operator depends on the state of the `ControlPlaneMachineSet` custom resource (CR) in your cluster. 

Clusters with an active generated CR:: Clusters that have a generated CR with an active state use the Operator by default. No administrator action is required. 
//+
//AWS clusters that are created with {product-title} version 4.12 or later use the Control Plane Machine Set Operator by default. 

Clusters with an inactive generated CR:: For clusters that include an inactive generated CR, you must review the CR configuration and xref:../../machine_management/control_plane_machine_management/cpmso-getting-started.adoc#cpmso-activating_cpmso-getting-started[activate the CR].
//+
//AWS clusters that are upgraded to {product-title} version 4.12 or later from an earlier version include an inactive generated CR.

Clusters without a generated CR:: For clusters that do not include a generated CR, you must xref:../../machine_management/control_plane_machine_management/cpmso-getting-started.adoc#cpmso-creating-cr_cpmso-getting-started[create and activate a CR] with the appropriate configuration for your cluster.
//+
//For Azure and VMware vSphere clusters

If you are uncertain about the state of the `ControlPlaneMachineSet` CR in your cluster, you can xref:../../machine_management/control_plane_machine_management/cpmso-getting-started.adoc#cpmso-checking-status_cpmso-getting-started[verify the CR status].

== Supported cloud providers

In {product-title} {product-version}, the Control Plane Machine Set Operator is supported for Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and VMware vSphere clusters.

The status of the Operator after installation depends on your cloud provider and the version of {product-title} that you installed on your cluster.
