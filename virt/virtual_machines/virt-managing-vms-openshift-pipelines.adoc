xref:../../cicd/pipelines/understanding-openshift-pipelines.adoc#understanding-openshift-pipelines[{pipelines-title}] is a Kubernetes-native CI/CD framework that allows developers to design and run each step of the CI/CD pipeline in its own container.

The Tekton Tasks Operator (TTO) integrates {VirtProductName} with {pipelines-shortname}. TTO includes cluster tasks and example pipelines that allow you to:

* Create and manage virtual machines (VMs), persistent volume claims (PVCs), and data volumes
* Run commands in VMs
* Manipulate disk images with `libguestfs` tools

== Example pipelines

The Tekton Tasks Operator includes the following example `Pipeline` manifests. You can run the example pipelines by using the web console or CLI.

Windows 10 installer pipeline:: This pipeline installs Windows 10 into a new data volume from a Windows installation image (ISO file). A custom answer file is used to run the installation process.

Windows 10 customize pipeline:: This pipeline clones the data volume of a basic Windows 10 installation, customizes it by installing Microsoft SQL Server Express, and then creates a new image and template.
