== Specification

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `apiVersion`
| `string`
| APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources

| `kind`
| `string`
| Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

| `metadata`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#io-k8s-apimachinery-pkg-apis-meta-v1-ObjectMeta[`ObjectMeta`]
| Standard object's metadata. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata

| `spec`
| `object`
| spec contains the configuration for the cluster image policy.

| `status`

Description::
+
--
spec contains the configuration for the cluster image policy.

Type::
  `object`

Required::
  - `policy`
  - `scopes`



[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `policy`
| `object`
| policy is a required field that contains configuration to allow scopes to be verified, and defines how
images not matching the verification policy will be treated.

| `scopes`
| `array (string)`
| scopes is a required field that defines the list of image identities assigned to a policy. Each item refers to a scope in a registry implementing the "Docker Registry HTTP API V2".
Scopes matching individual images are named Docker references in the fully expanded form, either using a tag or digest. For example, docker.io/library/busybox:latest (not busybox:latest).
More general scopes are prefixes of individual-image scopes, and specify a repository (by omitting the tag or digest), a repository
namespace, or a registry host (by only specifying the host name and possibly a port number) or a wildcard expression starting with `*.`, for matching all subdomains (not including a port number).
Wildcards are only supported for subdomain matching, and may not be used in the middle of the host, i.e.  *.example.com is a valid case, but example*.*.com is not.
This support no more than 256 scopes in one object. If multiple scopes match a given image, only the policy requirements for the most specific scope apply. The policy requirements for more general scopes are ignored.
In addition to setting a policy appropriate for your own deployed applications, make sure that a policy on the OpenShift image repositories
quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release, quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-v4.0-art-dev (or on a more general scope) allows deployment of the OpenShift images required for cluster operation.
If a scope is configured in both the ClusterImagePolicy and the ImagePolicy, or if the scope in ImagePolicy is nested under one of the scopes from the ClusterImagePolicy, only the policy from the ClusterImagePolicy will be applied.
For additional details about the format, please refer to the document explaining the docker transport field,
which can be found at: https://github.com/containers/image/blob/main/docs/containers-policy.json.5.md#docker

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `exactRepository`
| `object`
| exactRepository specifies the repository that must be exactly matched by the identity in the signature.
exactRepository is required if matchPolicy is set to "ExactRepository". It is used to verify that the signature claims an identity matching this exact repository, rather than the original image identity.

| `matchPolicy`
| `string`
| matchPolicy is a required filed specifies matching strategy to verify the image identity in the signature against the image scope.
Allowed values are "MatchRepoDigestOrExact", "MatchRepository", "ExactRepository", "RemapIdentity". When omitted, the default value is "MatchRepoDigestOrExact".
When set to "MatchRepoDigestOrExact", the identity in the signature must be in the same repository as the image identity if the image identity is referenced by a digest. Otherwise, the identity in the signature must be the same as the image identity.
When set to "MatchRepository", the identity in the signature must be in the same repository as the image identity.
When set to "ExactRepository", the exactRepository must be specified. The identity in the signature must be in the same repository as a specific identity specified by "repository".
When set to "RemapIdentity", the remapIdentity must be specified. The signature must be in the same as the remapped image identity. Remapped image identity is obtained by replacing the "prefix" with the specified “signedPrefix” if the the image identity matches the specified remapPrefix.

| `remapIdentity`
| `object`
| remapIdentity specifies the prefix remapping rule for verifying image identity.
remapIdentity is required if matchPolicy is set to "RemapIdentity". It is used to verify that the signature claims a different registry/repository prefix than the original image.

|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `repository`
| `string`
| repository is the reference of the image identity to be matched.

|===
=== .spec.policy.signedIdentity.remapIdentity

Description::

Type::
  `object`

Required::
  - `prefix`
  - `signedPrefix`



[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `prefix`
| `string`
| prefix is required if matchPolicy is set to "RemapIdentity".
prefix is the prefix of the image identity to be matched.
If the image identity matches the specified prefix, that prefix is replaced by the specified “signedPrefix” (otherwise it is used as unchanged and no remapping takes place).
This is useful when verifying signatures for a mirror of some other repository namespace that preserves the vendor’s repository structure.
The prefix and signedPrefix values can be either host[:port] values (matching exactly the same host[:port], string), repository namespaces,
or repositories (i.e. they must not contain tags/digests), and match as prefixes of the fully expanded form.
For example, docker.io/library/busybox (not busybox) to specify that single repository, or docker.io/library (not an empty string) to specify the parent namespace of docker.io/library/busybox.

| `signedPrefix`
| `string`
| signedPrefix is required if matchPolicy is set to "RemapIdentity".
signedPrefix is the prefix of the image identity to be matched in the signature. The format is the same as "prefix". The values can be either host[:port] values (matching exactly the same host[:port], string), repository namespaces,
or repositories (i.e. they must not contain tags/digests), and match as prefixes of the fully expanded form.
For example, docker.io/library/busybox (not busybox) to specify that single repository, or docker.io/library (not an empty string) to specify the parent namespace of docker.io/library/busybox.

This is the default behavior prior to v1.23. - Warn: This will send a warning via the standard warning response header for each unknown field that is dropped from the object, and for each duplicate field that is encountered. The request will still succeed if there are no other errors, and will only persist the last of any duplicate fields. This is the default in v1.23+ - Strict: This will fail the request with a BadRequest error if any unknown fields would be dropped from the object, or if any duplicate fields are present. The error returned from the server will contain all unknown and duplicate fields encountered.
