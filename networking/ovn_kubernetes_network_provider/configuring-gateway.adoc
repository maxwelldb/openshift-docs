toc::[]

As a cluster administrator you can configure the `gatewayConfig` object to manage how external traffic leaves the cluster. You do so by setting the `routingViaHost` parameter to one of the following values:

* `true` means that egress traffic routes through a specific local gateway on the node that hosts the pod. Egress traffic routes through the host and this traffic applies to the routing table of the host.
* `false` means that egress traffic routes through a dedicated node but a group of nodes share the same gateway. Egress traffic does not route through the host. The Open vSwitch (OVS) outputs traffic directly to the node IP interface.
